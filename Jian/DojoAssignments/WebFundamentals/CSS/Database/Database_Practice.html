                           <p>Database are a collection of information, they are used for creating,
                             manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases
                             and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or a
                             non-relational database. Relationships means a set of our data is related to
                             another section of our data. Our database are put into sections od data called
                             schemas, inside each schema each data is organized into tables contain columns
                             and rows to house that particular set of data.</p>

                             harddrive, often times large companies will have floors upon floors of
                             just database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer stores information
                             on the harddrive, we are able to create new information, read information,
                             update information and delete information.</p>

                           a database store one problem we might run into is finding the data we are
                           looking for. Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked to find
                           the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might start picking up each book,
                           checking the title and moving onto the next until you found it. That is very
                           slow as most libraries found it. Instead we were to ID each item we can find
                           it quickly.</p>

                           <p id="bottom_word">The amazing part of having a database is that it is a storage
                           bin that holds onto all save data. Well if only one user had access to that data
                           it's just like what we had built into out own computers, it would't be useful to
                           other users. However the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin
                           many user can interact with, creating, reading, updating, and deleting information
                           that all users would see.</p>

                             of information. As the Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount of
                             companies on the market. That being said a lot of their software is free for most
                             users, think of MySQL, which while being an incredible DB is completely free of cost
                             and is used by large company called Facebook.</p>
